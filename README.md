# AI-Based-Smart-Crop-Yield-Prediction-System
Crop Yield Prediction System is a AI–based predictive system designed to estimate crop yield using historical agricultural and environmental data. The project analyzes key factors such as year, average rainfall (mm/year), pesticide usage (tonnes), and average temperature to predict crop productivity measured in hectograms per hectare (hg/ha).
